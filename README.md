# Hello, I'm Martyna Grzegorczyk 🙋🏻‍♀️

I am a student of Applied Computer Science at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. Currently I am finishing third year of my studies. I have a knowledge about object-oriented programming as well as functional programming. What interests me the most is creating <b>web applications</b>. I have some experience with Django and I am developing my skills in Angular.
